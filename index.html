        I'm William Henderson, and I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student.
        I spend most of my time programming, along with a bit of video editing, but when I'm not sitting in front of my computer, I love to play the piano and compose music.
        I strive to improve at everything I do, and I'm always willing to learn something new.
        In this portfolio, you'll be able to browse some of my best projects.

        I've been programming since I was eight, starting with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> in primary school before swiftly moving on to Python.
        Now, alongside Python, I'm experienced in JavaScript and C#. Click below to start browsing the projects which I'm most proud of:<br>

        I've played the piano since I was just four, and I composed my first piece at six.
        Since then, I reached Grade 5 before quitting grades in favour of focusing on my composition skills.
        Alongside my work for GCSE Music, I've arranged numerous pieces for both my peers and my family to play across a wide range of genres.

        As well as showing my creativity through music, I also have quite a lot of experience in video editing.
        I've been editing since I was around nine, and I've used <a href="https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-express/specs">professional software</a> since thirteen.
        I'm able to edit in a variety of genres, as you'll see when you click the button below to browse my video projects:<br>
